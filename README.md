# Python Uncommon Error Example

This repository demonstrates two uncommon errors in Python: `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError`.  The code includes examples of how to trigger each error and some suggestions on handling them.

The `bug.py` file contains the code with the errors, and `bugSolution.py` shows how to improve the code using exception handling.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `bug.py`. Observe the errors.
3. Run `bugSolution.py` to see how to handle these errors gracefully.
